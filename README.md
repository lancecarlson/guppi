# Guppi

## Usage
To use guppi, run the following command in your terminal:

`guppi`

This will start the semi-autonomous coding assistant. The assistant will prompt you for the next task to complete based on the project description in your `project.md` file and the contents of relevant files. 

The assistant will ask for input or code to complete certain tasks, such as creating or modifying a file. Follow the prompts and provide the necessary input to complete the task. 

Once the assistant has completed all tasks in the project, it will exit and display a farewell message.
